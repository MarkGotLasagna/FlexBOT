    A simple Discord BOT, written in Python, to play local audio sources into voice channels
</div>

## Dir structure
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio   <-- where to store your audio sources
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_audio.ogg
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py <-- the BOT's brains
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env    <-- where to store the TOKEN
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

The BOT's token, used for _logging in_ to the WebSocket, should reside in a file called `.env` with the following syntax:
```
TOKEN = yourSecretTOKEN
```
## How it works
FlexBOT üíΩ's purpose is <u>to play audio sources</u>, <u>stored in some local directory</u>, <u>into a Discord voice channel</u>.</br>
The directory to be used is declared in `myDirectory`. </br>
Registered guilds are declared inside `myGuilds`.</br>

_Audio sources_ are to be intended as __audio files__ in `.ogg` format, since they provide a good balance between bitrate and therefore size.</br>
> keep in mind that changing the audio format may change performances considerably and HTTP errors may occur frequently (unsuccessful handshakes or DNS lookups)</br>


### Commands

<div align=center>
    <image src=/.pics/commands.png width=75%>
</div>

Commands registered _by default_ are:
- `/d` for __debugging purposes__, namely
    - _pinging_ the WebSocket to check latency (üèì Ping)
    - _getting info_ about the BOT's properties (‚ùì Info)
    - _getting available_ audio sources (üíø Sources)
- `/j` to __join__ the voice channel
- `/l` to __leave__ the voice channel
- `/r` to __randomly__ play an audio source
- `/p` to __play__ an audio source
- `/s` to __skip__ the playing audio source

The `/p` command's syntax is `/p ogg audioSource.ogg`, meaning it only accepts an argument called `ogg`, it being the _audio source to be played_. An autocompletion utility is provided to facilitate user input.</br>

`/r` is a particular _fun_ way to play audio in the voice channel as it does not have an autocomplete function.

> Both `/r` and `/p` will instantiate `/j` first, if necessary.

Some __error handling__ is present.</br>
You can change the messages to be printed if your command fails, e.g.:
- `notInVoice = "üö´: not in a voice channel"`
- `notFound = "üö´: not an audio source"`
- ...

__Logging__ is also present:</br>
- the `Timer()` class will allow you to _time events_ by simply calling `myTempo.start()` to start the timing and `myTempo.stop()` to stop it, printing to console the elapsed time
- `printInColor(arg1,arg2)` will allow you to _print colored text_ to tag important events during code execution

Dependencies are defined in the [Pipfile](/Pipfile).</br>

The BOT's execution was tested using _virtual environments_ automatically set up by [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).</br>

```
pip install --user pipenv
```

The following commands will _clone_ the repository, _cd_ into it and _create_ a Python virtual environment for you.
```
git clone https://github.com/MarkGotLasagna/FlexBOT && \
    cd FlexBOT && \
    pipenv install
```
By running
```
python3 main.py
```
your bot will start execution and print to terminal the logs.
